# Teaching Scratch in Elbasan üá¶üá±

Last week, I had the chance to join [iStep](https://istep.ch) for a volunteer project in **Elbasan, Albania**, where we introduced kids and teenagers to the basics of programming using **Scratch**.

It was my first time being part of this experience. I didn‚Äôt know exactly what to expect ‚Äì a new place, new people, and a completely different environment. But right from the start, I felt welcomed. The team was great, and the kids were super motivated and full of energy.

## Coding with Scratch ‚Äì Step by Step

We used a nearby school as our classroom and worked closely with [A2B](https://a2balbania.org), which is just next door. **A2B - Hope for the Future** is a place where kids can eat, do homework, and hang out ‚Äì many of them see it as a second home. It was really moving to see how much this place means to them.

Together with Maxim, we started each day with a bit of theory on the screen and then jumped into small interactive projects. We built games together using Scratch, always with clear goals so the kids could work step by step.

## Seeing Progress and Excitement

It was amazing to see how quickly the kids picked things up. Even though none of them had coded before, they were able to build their own small games after just a few sessions. The excitement when something worked ‚Äì when a game finally ran or a character moved as expected ‚Äì was something I won‚Äôt forget.

> One of my favorite moments was seeing their faces light up when their code actually worked. You could tell they were proud.

## More Than Just a Course

Outside the workshops, we had time to explore a bit too. The iStep team often went for dinner together, and one afternoon we went for a short hike with Maxim and Petre. It was a great way to experience the nature and lifestyle in Albania a bit more closely.

What touched me the most, though, was how **grateful** the kids were. Many of them don‚Äôt have much, but they come to A2B with a smile and are thankful for every small thing. That kind of appreciation really stayed with me.

## Final Thoughts

This week meant a lot to me. It wasn‚Äôt just about teaching programming ‚Äì it was about meeting people, sharing moments, and seeing how much impact a simple workshop can have.  

I'm thankful I got to be part of this and hope we left something positive behind for the kids.
