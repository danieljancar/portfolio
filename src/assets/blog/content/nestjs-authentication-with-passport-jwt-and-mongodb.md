# Introduction

Basic secure authentication is a key component of many applications. The most common way to implement authentication is to use a username and password. However, this is not the most secure way to authenticate a user. A more secure way is to use a token-based authentication system. In this article, we will learn how to implement token-based authentication using Passport and JWT in a NestJS application. We will also use MongoDB as our database.

```ts
import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';

@Module({
  imports: [],
  controllers: [],
  providers: [],
})

export class AppModule {}
```
