# We Tried to Win Best dApp, But Won Vivid Video Award Instead! 🎉

## Our Journey from Lunchtime Idea to dApp (and a Surprise Video Win)

I’m super excited to share the ups, downs, and unexpected twists of our adventure in the Stellar Smart Contract Dev Challenge. My buddy Cyril Kurmann and I went all in, trying to win the Best dApp award with our project **VoteVault**. While we didn’t quite clinch that title, we did walk away with something pretty awesome—**the Vivid Video Award** and $6000! 💰

## What’s VoteVault? 🤔

So, here’s the scoop: **VoteVault** is our secure, transparent, and open-source voting platform built on the Stellar blockchain. The idea? Make voting easy, engaging, and, dare we say, a little bit fun. We wanted to do something different from the usual crypto stuff, so we focused on a platform that anyone could use to create, participate in, and verify votes. No crazy animations, just good ol' reliable blockchain tech doing its thing.

## How We Ended Up Winning the Vivid Video Award 📹

Here’s where things get interesting. After wrapping up VoteVault (and thinking we might have a shot at Best dApp), we found ourselves with a bit of time left before the competition deadline. Instead of just sitting around, we decided to make a video tutorial on Stellar smart contracts. Why not, right?

Inspired by Fireship’s “100 Seconds” series, we wanted to create something short, sweet, and packed with info. Cyril tackled the scripting and narration while I worked on editing the video. The result? A concise and (hopefully) helpful tutorial for anyone diving into Stellar smart contracts. To our surprise, this side project ended up winning us the **Vivid Video Award**! 🚀

## Wrapping It All Up 🎬

What started as a simple lunchtime idea turned into a wild ride of coding from tropical locations (Sri Lanka for Cyril, Italy for me), late-night Discord chats, and even a surprise award win. While we didn’t get the Best dApp title we were gunning for, winning the Vivid Video Award feels like a pretty awesome consolation prize.

Feel free to check out VoteVault, watch our award-winning video, and let us know what you think! We’re proud of what we’ve accomplished and excited to see where this journey takes us next.

**Cheers,**
Daniel
