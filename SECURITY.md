# **Reporting Security Issues**

I take security bugs in my projects seriously. I appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, email [dan_jan1@icloud.com](mailto:dan_jan1@icloud.com) and include the word "SECURITY" in the subject line.

I will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, I will endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.
